# Mobile ERP System for Schools

ERP systems for schools have conventionally been ignored.
The coveted Content Resource Management (CRM) systems have always been reserved for larger companies that require large scale
database. Not for long, with this unique mobile ERP system that is bound to revolutionize the education industry.

Note: This project is still under work, considering that it uses realtime databases and user authentication
coupled with interactive and responsive UIs. It's status will be periodically updated below.

The primary coding language is Dart, developed by Flutter (a subsidiary of Google DevOps). My IDE
is Android Studio, but the files run on other platforms including VS Code and IntelliJ. As the project progresses, this ReadMe
will be regularly updated with significant features, and high-fidelity UI frameworks.

## Last update

The directories and folders have been created based on the needs of this project.

## Current status

The UI is being developed at present for the various screens. Broadly classified, these are:
- Login screen (uniform across roles)
- Student home page, timetable, assignments, and fee status
- Teacher home page, timetable, and assignments
- Admin home page, overall timetable, consolidated timetable, write and remove students from the database, fee status updating

## Next steps

Post screen UI creation for these various pages, the next step is to implement the Firebase Auth plugin to ensure role based logging.
Then, appropriate routes will be mapped between different pages to facilitate app navigation.
Lastly, the Firestore cloud database will be populated with data that will be available based on the user's role.

Stay tuned for more updates! Cheers!
