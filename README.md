# Mobile ERP System for Schools

ERP systems for schools have conventionally been ignored.
The coveted Content Resource Management (CRM) systems have always been reserved for larger companies that require large scale
database. Not for long, with this unique mobile ERP system that is bound to revolutionize the education industry.

Note: This project is still under work, considering that it uses realtime databases and user authentication
coupled with interactive and responsive UIs.

The primary coding language is Dart, developed by Flutter (a subsidiary of Google DevOps). My IDE
is Android Studio, but the files run on other platforms including VS Code and IntelliJ. As the project progresses, this ReadMe
will be regularly updated with significant features, and high-fidelity UI frameworks.

Cheers!
